# Chapter 1 Introduction 

Most two- and three-dimensional video games are examples of what computer scientists would call *soft real-time interactive agent-based computer simulations*.

### FPS

First-person shooters typically focus on technologies:

- Effect rendering of large 3D virtual worlds;
- A response camera control/ aiming mechanic
- High-fidelity animations of the player's virtual arms and weapons
- A wide range of powerful handeld weaponry
- A forgiveing player charater motion and collision model, which often gives these games a "floaty" feel
-  High-fidelity animations and artificial intelligence for the non-player characters (NPCs)—the player’s enemies and allies; and

### Fighting Games

FIghting Games are typically two player games involving humanoid charaters pummeling each other in a ring of some sort

The definition of this games on wiki: [Fighting_game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighting_game)

The techinology which the games focused on is that:

- A rich set of fighting animations;
- Accumulate hit detection
- A user input system capable of detecting complex button and joystick combination
- **Crowds, but othervise relatively static backgournds**

The 3-D fighting games technology was focused on:

- High  definition charater graphics
- Realistic skin shaders with subsurface scattering and sweat effectsl
- photo-realistic lighting and particle effects
- High-fidelity charater animations
- Physics-based cloth and hair simulations for the charaters

### Racing Games

Racing game encompasse all games whose primary task is driving car/vehicle or other some of track
